```text

**Status:** ✅ **PASSED** - Database connection established successfully

## Test Environment Details

### System Configuration

- **Ruby Version:** 3.4.5 (via .ruby-version)
- **Rails Version:** 8.0.3
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (diquis_development)
- **Test Framework:** RSpec 7.0+
- **Bundle Status:** All dependencies satisfied

### Test Coverage Areas

1. **Health Check Endpoint** - `/health` returns 200 OK
2. **ApplicationController** - Proper API inheritance and configuration
3. **ApplicationRecord** - Correct ActiveRecord setup with abstract base
4. **Code Quality** - RuboCop style compliance
5. **Security** - Brakeman vulnerability scan
6. **Dependencies** - Complete gem bundle verification
7. **Database** - PostgreSQL connectivity

### Fixed Issues During Verification

#### Issue: Missing Health Check Route

- **Problem:** Health check test failing with 404 error
- **Solution:** Added `/health` route in `config/routes.rb`
- **Code Change:**

  ```ruby
  # Simple health check endpoint for tests and monitoring
  get "health" => proc { [ 200, {}, [ "OK" ] ] }
  ```

#### Issue: RuboCop Style Violations

- **Problem:** 5 style offenses in routes.rb (spacing and string quotes)
- **Solution:** Auto-corrected with `bundle exec rubocop -A`
- **Result:** All style violations resolved

## Test Performance Metrics

### Test Execution Speed

- **Total Time:** 0.08094 seconds
- **File Load Time:** 1.27 seconds  
- **Examples per Second:** ~62 tests/second

### Slowest Examples

1. Health Check GET /health: 0.05869s
2. ApplicationRecord abstract class check: 0.00344s
3. ApplicationController inheritance: 0.00117s

## Verification Checklist

- [x] **Bundle dependencies installed and satisfied**
- [x] **Rails application boots without errors**
- [x] **RSpec test suite runs and passes completely**
- [x] **Database connectivity established**
- [x] **Code quality standards met (RuboCop)**
- [x] **Security scan completed with no warnings (Brakeman)**
- [x] **Health check endpoint functional**
- [x] **All controller/model foundations working**

## Conclusion

**✅ VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL**

The Diquis Football Academy management system setup is **fully functional** and ready for development:

1. **All dependencies properly installed** (58 gems)
2. **Test framework operational** (RSpec with 5 passing examples)  
3. **Rails 8.0.3 environment stable** and configured correctly
4. **Code quality tools working** (RuboCop, Brakeman)
5. **Database connectivity established** (PostgreSQL)
6. **Basic API infrastructure functional** (health checks, base classes)

The development environment is **verified and ready** for implementing the vertical slice architecture and core business features.

## Next Steps

With the setup verification complete, the project is ready for:

- Implementing core models (Academy, Player, Team, etc.)
- Building service layer components
- Creating API endpoints
- Adding authentication and authorization
- Developing the complete feature set per the architecture documentation

**Environment Status:** ✅ **PRODUCTION READY FOR DEVELOPMENT**
